Description: SharePathway
        ============
        
        SharePathway is a python package for KEGG pathway enrichment analysis with multiple gene lists.
        
        There have been dozens of tools or web servers for enrichment analysis using a list of candidate genes from some kinds of high throughput experiments,such as Exome-Seq and RNA-Seq. But the reality is that we usually get multiple gene lists, each from one sample or patient. We can do enrichment analysis for each sample then check which pathway or module is enriched. This strategy is simple and commonly used in cancer study. But we may lose some important driver genes.
        
        SharePathway is motivated at providing users a simple and easy-to-use tool for enrichment analysis on multiple lists of genes simultaneously, which may help gain insight into the underlying biological background of these lists of genes.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        This version is for both python2 and python3.
        The first step is to install Python. Python is available from the `Python project page <https://www.python.org/>`_ . The next step is install sharepathway.
        
        Install from PyPi using `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/>`_, a
        package manager for Python::
        
            $ pip install sharepathway
        
        Or, you can download the source code at `Github <https://github.com/GuipengLi/SharePathway>`_  or at `PyPi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sharepathway>`_ for SharePathway, and then run::
        
            $ python setup.py install
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Assume you have put all the path of your gene list files in one summary file genelists.txt (one path per line) in the directory ~/data/. Go into this directory,open python and run the scripts below. The result will be saved in the result.html file::
        
        	import sharepathway as sp
        	filein="genelists.txt"
        	fileout="result"
        	sp.Run(fi=filein,fo=fileout,species='hsa',r=0.1)
        
        The default value of species is 'hsa', represents human species.
        The ratio r is the min threshold. The default value is 0.01.
        Entrez Gene ID is supported. The result will be output to a html file.
